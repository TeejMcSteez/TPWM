# Goals for the Project
I want to make my own password manager that I can use for my local devices (Apple, Windows, or Linux) to store important passwords locally instead of keeping them on the cloud or saved also to understand how much work goes into securing user information within the system and not on a lock-downed database like MySQL or MongoDB
